Use Strict

It makes debugging easier

1. By enabling strict mode, we enter into a restricted variant of JavaScript that will not tolerate the usage of variables before they are declared.
2. Please make sure that "use strict" is at the top of your scripts, otherwise strict mode may not be enabled.
3. If we want to invoke strict mode only in functions instead of whole script file, just use 'use script' in top of that function.
4. Cannot use reserved keyword for example: let, private, protected, public, static
5. Error when variables are attempted to be deleted using the delete operator.
6. eval() of strict mode code does not introduce new variables into the surrounding scope. 


Meanings :
1. eval() - The argument of the eval() function is a string. If the string represents an expression, eval() evaluates the expression. If the argument represents one or more JavaScript statements, eval() evaluates the statements.
